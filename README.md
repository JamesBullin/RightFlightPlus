### Sprint Retrospective

* Possibly spending too much time on documentation, and updating the kanban board
* We faced some difficulties with merging work from different team members. This may have been due to improper use of branches and pull requests. In addition, changes were made to the project that were not saved when commits were made, leading to some confusion.

On the whole, the first sprint has been very productive.
